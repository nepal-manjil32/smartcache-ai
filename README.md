## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Caching:** SmartCache AI uses a caching mechanism to store frequently queried results for quick retrieval, minimizing redundant LLM calls.  
2. **Embeddings:** Generates custom vector embeddings for semantic search, ensuring high query relevance.  
3. **Subprocess-based Querying:** Optimizes backend LLM interactions with subprocess calls.  
4. **Visualization:** Real-time insights are displayed using Plotly and Streamlit Components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Add support for more LLMs and embedding models.  
- Integrate cloud-based storage for cache sharing across multiple sessions.  
- Implement advanced analytics for query trends.
